        <p><h3><strong>Hello</strong></h3> my name is McCarty Johnson. I am an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, Washington.
             I am currently studying HTML, CSS, SQL, and Javascript. I hope to find a job doing 
             software development in the Seattle area by the end of the year.
