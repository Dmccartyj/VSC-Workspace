        Hope this works! I would really like to have a website that is completely my own, in a unique style that suits me. I woudld like for it to have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An animated header</li>
            <li>An animated navigation bar</li>
            <li>Something of substance where I can express my thoughts while also practicing code</li>
            <li>Pictures that link to good stuff</li>
            <li>A table that can give me an ongoing refrence guide for code that I use a lot.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Hopefully I'll be able to accomplish that by this weekend. Work hard on it McCarty, this is you applying yourself for yourself. You are actively trying to change your life.
        Here's a picture of a dog to make u smile.
